EduPro is a clean, responsive E-Learning Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a basic front-end template for an online learning platform, allowing users to explore courses, track their progress, and watch embedded video lectures. The layout features a fixed sidebar for navigation, a header with a toggle menu for smaller screens, and four main sectionsâ€”Dashboard, Courses, Progress, and Lecture. Each section is styled using modern CSS (Flexbox and Grid), and the interface adapts well to both desktop and mobile devices. The sidebar toggle is powered by simple JavaScript, making the site interactive without any frameworks. This project is great for beginners looking to practice front-end development skills, understand layout design, and create a real-world UI.
